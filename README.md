# KanjiCrypt

## About

KanjiCrypt encrypts your text with kanjis from 4 different languages (korean, japanese, chinese, vietnamese). As each alphanumeric letter can be represented by multiple kanjis, there are multiple encrypted kanji combinations that can represent the same text. A specific combination can be saved by entering a key below the input, by default the key is the text entered in the input.

To decrypt a kanji string, the key used to create it is needed.
